title: New Relic IBM MQ Monitor
description: |
 IBM MQ MQ allows independent and potentially non-concurrent applications on a distributed system to securely communicate with each other, using messages. MQ is available on a large number of platforms (both IBM and non-IBM), including z/OS (mainframe), IBM i, Transaction Processing Facility, UNIX (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris), HP NonStop, OpenVMS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows.

 The New Relic IBM MQ Monitor allows you to monitor the performance of MQ Objects like channels and queues . The metrics collected include depth of your queues, how much space your queues have for additional messages, and the age of a queueâ€™s oldest message. Analyzing metrics over time allows you to scale your instances accordingly in order to prevent full queues, which can delay message delivery. 

summary: |
  The New Relic IBM MQ Monitor enables performance monitoring of IBM MQ Objects like channels, topics and queues.
