## Quickstarts style guide

### Style tips

- Maintain a strong active voice. Lead sentences with verbs.
  - Avoid “Allows you to monitor your uptime”
- Avoid being too formal. Avoid words like `thus` and `lastly`, and feel free to use `we` and `our`.
- In general, we should only lightly touch on what a given technology does. The user is already using Node, so we don’t need to sell them on it exactly. What we need to focus on is the challenges of monitoring that technology and then sell on that.

Check out our [doc team's voice and tone guidelines](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/style-guide/writing-guidelines/voice-strategies-docs-sound-new-relic/).

### Quickstarts usage

When writing about a quickstart the following language rules should be followed:

1. Capitalize the term quickstart if the word is at the start of a sentence or header.

> "Quickstarts are a great way to get started with New Relic!"

2. If the term quickstarts is anywhere else in a sentence, use lower case.

> "New Relic offers you a wide range of quickstarts to get you started."

3. Quickstarts is always a single word.

> "Always use quickstarts, not quick starts."

### Quickstarts description template

```md
Brief overview of the technology. Keep this broad enough to inform users who are unaware of the technology, but it should not dive too deep. 1 paragraph.

Helpful questions:
- What type of technology is it?
- Who are the intended users?
- What differentiates it from competitors and similar technologies?

What you get
Brief overview of visibility provided by key metrics/dashboards/synthetic checks in the kit.. Focus on the specific areas the kit provides visibility to. 1-2 paragraphs.

Helpful questions:
- What makes our instrumentation unique or powerful?
- How does it compare to competitors?
- How does the kit enable the user?
  - A kit for a language may highlight errors while a cloud infrastructure kit might highlight performance or the cluster/node level monitored.
  - Liberally intertwine the technology and New Relic.

Description for each “feature” included in the kit. 1-2 lines.

Dashboards:
  - Example focus: Monitor your transactions
Synthetic monitors
  - Example focus: Proactively monitors your uptime.
Alerts
  - Example focus: Alert triggers when latency exceeds a set limit.
```

## Quickstarts contributor guidelines

We encourage all contributors to actively engage in the creation and maintenance of quickstarts. Whether you work at New Relic or use New Relic as a customer, the community is open to your expertise!

- `Step 1`: Review the [quickstart Template Config](./_template/config.yml) for a definition of how to create a quickstart.
- `Step 2`: Review the [documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/blob/main/docs) for structure and limits you need to consider.
- `Step 3`: Create your quickstart!
- `Step 4`: Submit a PR!
- `Step 5`: resolve feedback from code reviews.
- `Step 6`: after approval, merge your PR.

When creating a new quickstart or reviewing a PR please keep the following in mind, and refer to the
[quickstart validation workflow](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/blob/main/.github/workflows/validate_quickstarts.yml) for current validations.

### Quick start best practices

Before getting started, review the [documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/blob/main/docs)
for quickstart structure and limits you need to consider.

#### InstallPlans

> See the [docs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/blob/main/docs/main_config.md#installPlans) for more details on `installPlans`.

- The Ordering of `installPlans` is important as it sets the order of installation in the guided install flow for a user.
- Every quick start that should be "installable" needs a `documentation URL` and an `installPlan` configuration if you want use the guided install flow.

#### Summary & descriptions


> See the [docs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/blob/main/docs/main_config.md#description) for more details on `description` and `summary`.

- Use the proper YAML formatting `|` for URL `description` and `summary`.
- Please review the [YAML cheat sheet](https://lzone.de/cheat-sheet/YAML) for more details.
- Descriptions shouldn't have `H1` headers. Use `H2` and `H3` only.

```yml
description: |
  a description of the quickstart.

summary: |
  a summary of the quickstart.
```

#### Documentation

> See the [docs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/blob/main/docs/main_config.md#documentation) for more details on `documentation`

- The first `documentation URL` listed in the documentation configuration should be the primary doc reference.
- The see installation docs buttons will always link to the primary `documentation URL`.
- Every quick start that should be "installable" needs a `documentation URL` and an `installPlan` configuration if you want use the guided install flow.
- Use the proper YAML formatting `|` for the URL description
- Use the proper YAML formatting `>-` for documentation URL references.
- Please review the [YAML cheat sheet](https://lzone.de/cheat-sheet/YAML) for more details.

```yml
documentation:
  - name: Name of documentation
    description: |
      Description of documentation
    url: >-
      https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/url/
```

#### Levels

> See the [docs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/blob/main/docs/main_config.md#level) for more details on `levels`

- All quickstarts will be set to `Community` level by default unless specified differently by the `Author`.
- Levels can only be modified by New Relic employees.
- If you have questions on how to increase the level of support please file an [issue](../../issues)

#### Dashboard images (screenshots)

> See the [docs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/blob/main/docs/dashboard_config.md#pages_items_anyOf_i0_additionalProperties) for more details `dashboards`

- Dashboard images are `optional` but highly recommended to preview the visual functionality of a dashboard.
- file name should be `quickstart_name01`, `quickstart_name02`, etc
- Dashboards images should be stored in the quickstart's dashboard directory. ex: `/quickstart_name01/dashboards`.
- Must be in `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` or `.svg` format
- Each image file must be less than `4MB` in size
- There should be no more than `6`  dashboard images per dashboard
- For best results use aspect ratio: 3:2
- For best results use 800 px (width)
- For best results use 1600 px (height)

#### Logos

> See the [docs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/blob/main/docs/main_config.md#logo) for more details `logos`

- Logo files should go in the root quickstart directory, `/quickstarts_name01`
- Logos are `optional` but highly recommended to call attention to your quickstart.
- `.png` or `.jpeg` or `.svg` format
- Max 1
- Aspect ratio: 1:1
- 250px (width) x 100px (height)

### Icons

> See the [docs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/blob/main/docs/main_config.md#icon) for more details on `icon`

### Keywords

> See the [docs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/blob/main/docs/main_config.md#keywords) for more details on `keywords`

When adding keywords to a quickstart the following format should be used.  Keywords are used in UI navigation, filters and labels within
the New Relic One I/O Catalog and the External I/O Catalog.

``` yml
keywords:
  - a keyword
  - another keyword
  - yet another keyword
```

Keywords are strictly defined and you should provide a standard set of keywords in your quickstart from the list below. If you submit a keyword
