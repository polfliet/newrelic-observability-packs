title: MongoDB monitoring integration
description: |
  Our MongoDB integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MongoDB cluster to our platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. We collect data on mongos, mongods, and config servers, as well as on databases and collections to help pinpoint performance bottlenecks.

  As part of this integration we will install the New Relic Infrastructure agent.
