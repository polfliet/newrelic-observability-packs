title: HAProxy monitoring integration
description: |
  Our HAProxy integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your HAProxy instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics for the HAProxy server, frontends, and backends.

  As part of this integration we will install the New Relic Infrastructure agent.
