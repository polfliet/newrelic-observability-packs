# Description of the quickstart
description: |+
  A set of example dashboards based on New Relic Browser agent data. Browser measures page load timing, also known as Real User Monitoring (RUM). But it goes far beyond that to measure:

  - Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity, filtered by geographical regions important to your business, or by user satisfaction (Apdex) scores

  - Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display

  - JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and source maps with line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself

  - Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle

  - AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage

  - Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures
