# New Relic One quickstarts

> ðŸ§ª This project is currently in an `ALPHA` state ðŸ§ª

New Relic One quickstarts help accelerate your New Relic journey by providing immediate value for your specific use cases. They include:

- Clear instructions for instrumenting your services
- Observability building blocks like dashboards and alerts

All of this is available through an open ecosystem where New Relic developers, partners, and customers contribute their best-practice solutions.

## Quickstart components

### ðŸ“Š Dashboards

With [New Relic One dashboards](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/) you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting.

> You can't copy/paste a dashboard's json directly from the repository to create a dashboard within New Relic. You will need to add "permissions": "PUBLIC_READ_WRITE",to the json prior to adding the dashboard to your account.

### ðŸ“Ÿ Alerts

[Alerts](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts/) lets you set up robust and customizable alert policies for anything that you can monitor. Receive notifications for fluctuations in key performance metrics as data streams in from all of our products, including APM, infrastructure, browser, mobile, and NRQL queries.

### ðŸ’½ Data Sources

[Data Sources](https://developer.newrelic.com/collect-data/collect-data-from-any-source/) are the many sources of data you can setup with New Relic to collect and monitor data.

### ðŸ”® Future

Our road map for quickstarts includes the addition of [Synthetics monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/get-started-synthetic-monitoring/), [NerdPacks](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps/) and [Flex configurations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration/).

## Getting Started

Contribute your own quickstart to the New Relic One catalog by following the steps below:

1. [Fork the Github repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository)

2. [Clone your own repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

3. Copy the `_template` directory and its content to a new directory within the `quickstarts` folder. Choose a name which identifies the purpose of your quickstart, such as `rabbitmq`, `apm-errors`, `sre`, or `aws-s3`

4. In your new directory, you'll find the following folders: `dashboards` and `alerts` . Each folder contains a template or template directories that you can use to create entities for your quickstart.

- For example, to add an existing dashboard to your quickstart, [copy the dashboard's JSON](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/#dash-json), and save it as a JSON file in the `dashboards` directory. Next, create a screenshot of your dashboard, add it to `dashboards`, and give it the same name as your JSON file.

- You can add multiple JSON files and screenshots to `dashboards`. Pair each screenshot with a JSON file by using the same file name. If you want multiple screenshots for a dashboard, add a number at the end of the file name. So, your `dashboards` folder might contain:

      - `rabbitmq.json`
      - `rabbitmq.png` or `rabbitmq.jpeg`
      - `rabbitmq01.png`
      - `rabbitmq02.png`

- This process is similar for all other entity directories. Also, if you don't want to create entities for a given type, delete the corresponding directory.

5. In your quickstart's root directory, you'll find a `config.yml` file where you can configure your quickstart. Refer to our [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on quickstart configurations.

6. Commit your changes using the [Conventional Commit syntax](./CONTRIBUTING.md#using-conventional-commits):

    ```sh
    git add -A
    git commit -m "feat([name]): Added [name]"
    ```

7. Push your changes to Github:

    ```sh
    git push
    ```

8. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) in the [parent repository](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/compare?expand=1).

9. Submit and wait for review. Please be available to resolve review feedback in a timely manner.

## Testing

### Importer

> WARNING: The importer is for testing only and might change or be removed in the future. You can still use it today for testing, but it is not meant to be used in a production environment.

We've included an `importer` utility for testing quickstarts on your account. You can run this using the included [import.sh](./import.sh) script.

> Note: The importer spins up a docker container, so you must have docker installed and running for this to function

1. Modify [importer-config.sh](./importer-config.sh) with your account number and New Relic API Key
2. Run [import.sh](./import.sh) from the root of this project:

   ```bash
   # Usage:
   ./import.sh $QUICKSTART_NAME

   # Example
   > ./import.sh mysql
   ```

## Support
