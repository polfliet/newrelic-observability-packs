title: Apache monitoring integration
description: |
  Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

  As part of this integration we will install the New Relic Infrastructure agent.
