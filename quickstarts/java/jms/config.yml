  # What is JMS?

  Java Messaging Library for asynchronously sending and receiving data and events.


  ## Get started!

  Leverage community expertise and instantly get value out of your telemetry data. This quickstart automatically instruments JMS with the New Relic Java agent, and allows you to instantly monitor your Java application with out-of-the-box dashboards and alerts. 
  Further leverage New Relic's APM capabilities by setting up [errors inbox](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/), [transaction tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/introduction-transaction-traces/), and [service maps](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/introduction-service-maps/).
