title: Varnish Cache monitoring integration
description: |
  The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels.

  As part of this integration we will install the New Relic Infrastructure agent.
