title: Microsoft SQL Server monitoring integration
description: |
  Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems.

  As part of this integration we will install the New Relic Infrastructure agent.
