details: |+
  This alert is triggered when the number of slow queries per second is greater than 5 for 5 minutes, which could indicate capacity issues or a query that has been changed and is experiencing performance issues.
  The Slow_queries counter increments based on your settings applied to MySQL's long_query_time parameter (default 10s), which you can review with this query:
  SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'long_query_time';
