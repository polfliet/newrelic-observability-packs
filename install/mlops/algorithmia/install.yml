title: Algorithmia Machine Learning Performance Tracking
description: |
  Algorithmia Insights provides tools for deploying your machine-learning models into production. By integrating, Algorithmia's integration with New Relic, you'll be able to instrument, analyze, troubleshoot, and optimize your machine-learning performance across your entire system. By rigorously observing your capabilities, you'll be able to react quickly to changes in the model's input or output and the relationship between the two.

  Send your model performance metrics from Algorithmia Insights to New Relic and you'll have real-time monitoring for your algorithms. You'll explore your metrics data with user-friendly charts and learn the state of your algorithms at a glance for faster and more efficient troubleshooting.
