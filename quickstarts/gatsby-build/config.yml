  The Gatsby quickstart allows you to get visibility into the build time of your Gatsby Sites, 
  using [Open Telemetry](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/introduction-opentelemetry-new-relic/)
  to collect each step as a span in a Distributed Trace. This Dashboard lets you monitor your build in real-time to highlight which steps are affecting performance,
  so you can improve them faster.
